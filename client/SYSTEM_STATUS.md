## 🚀 How to Use the System

### 1. Start the AI Server
```bash
# Windows
cd D:\Code\CELO\VeriLeaf\client
python start_ai_server.py

# Or use the batch file
.\start_ai_server.bat
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd D:\Code\CELO\VeriLeaf\client
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the Application
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5173`
- **AI API**: `http://localhost:5000`

### 4. Test the System
1. Navigate to the **Verify** page
2. Click **"Use Sample Images"** to test with built-in images
3. Or upload your own before/after images
4. Click **"Run Analysis"** to see results

## 🔧 System Architecture

### Backend (Python)
```
ai_pipeline/
├── vegetation_analyzer.py    # Core analysis engine
├── api_server.py            # Flask REST API
├── requirements.txt         # Dependencies
└── run_analysis.py         # Command-line tool
```

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
```
src/
├── pages/Verify.tsx         # Main analysis page
├── services/vegetationAnalysis.ts  # API integration
└── components/             # UI components
```

### Key Features
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live processing of uploaded images
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Based on remote sensing standards
- **Impact Scoring**: Weighted algorithm for environmental assessment
- **Confidence Metrics**: Statistical reliability assessment
- **CO2 Estimation**: Environmental impact quantification

---

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Analysis Speed**: ~2-3 seconds per image pair
- **Accuracy**: High confidence for good quality images
- **Scalability**: Can handle multiple concurrent requests
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and validation

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If AI Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check dependencies
python -c "import flask, numpy, cv2; print('Dependencies OK')"

# Install missing packages
pip install -r ai_pipeline/requirements.txt

# Start manually
cd ai_pipeline
python api_server.py
```

### If Frontend Can't Connect
1. Verify AI server is running: `http://localhost:5000/health`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure CORS is enabled (it is by default)

### If Analysis Fails
1. Check image file formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF supported)
2. Ensure images have good contrast and detail
3. Try with the built-in sample images first

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Development
1. **Custom Images**: Upload your own before/after satellite imagery
2. **API Integration**: Use the REST API for custom applications
3. **Scaling**: Deploy to cloud services for production use

### For Production
1. **Security**: Add authentication and rate limiting
2. **Database**: Store analysis results and user data
3. **Monitoring**: Add logging and performance monitoring
4. **Deployment**: Use production WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
